# SurviveTomorrow

## About
SurviveTomorrow is a 3D survival game where the player needs to survive while also tackling obstacles, which are a consequence of harsh climate.

## Plot and Mechanics
The game is set in the near future (about 30 years from now) where the climate clock has dropped to 0 and beyond, and it is impossible to reverse climate change. Survival on Earth since then has become very difficult due to climate change. Polar caps have melted and raised the sea level to a point where hardly any area remains dry. Scorching Sun has led to forest fires and destruction of crops. Riots broke out and a major population of the planet began to starve. This also led to a plague which infected humans and animals and made them very aggressive and thirsty for blood. Frequent acid rains have demolished buildings and corroded them. Unable to reverse the climate effect, most of the remaining humans have evacuated Earth for Titan.

The main player, Lahron, is the last human and is stranded on the last standing human outpost on Earth. He needs to power up the beacon and call the shuttle orbiting the Earth to pick him up before heading to humanityâ€™s new home. Lahron needs to navigate his way in a day and night cycle to activate the beacon while also surviving obstacles like acid rains, toxic atmosphere and infected humans. He also has to gather drinkable water and food before he can find the power source to activate the beacon. He needs to refill his oxygen regularly to ensure survivability in the toxic atmosphere.

The player loses his life if he is out of health or oxygen. Lahron needs to meet the three objectives of finding water, food and power source to win the game.
